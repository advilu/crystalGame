# crystalGame

Here we have a fun mathematics game where one can practice memory, addition, and subtraction skills, as well as test their luck.

Directions:
  1. The game loads with a set numerical target.  Each crystal (red, blue, green, yellow) has a specific numerical value that stays consistent for each round.  The player has to click one or more crystals in the correct amount so that their total score matches the target.  If they go over the target, they lose.
  2.  After each win or loss, the player needs to restart the game.  This will create a new target, reset thier total score, and assign new values to the crystals, and add to either their wins or losses count.
